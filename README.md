Paleswan Pukhu (In Nepal Bhasa: Lotus pond) is a repository of documents related to Nepal Bhasa and its script, the Nepal Lipi.
This repository is open to all those who would like to read about Nepal Bhasa and its script, the Nepal Lipi. Nepal Bhasa is the language originated in the country Nepal while Nepal Lipi, the script originated in this land. Hence they have been named after Nepal, the country they have originated. As a student of languages, their scripts, I am pleased to share with the world what I have learnt and come to know about Nepal Bhasa and Nepal Lipi. One simple finding is that Nepal Bhasa is one of the shortest languages in the world. Its script is so beautiful that it has spread beyond its borders from Tibet to Japan via China, Korea and Taiwan in the east. The Nepal Lipi in its beaytified form has further spread upto Sri Lanka via South-east Asia. However, as it goes to say "twadewankoe matan makhan (In Nepal Bhasa: lamp lights around as it sheds itself, Nepal Bhasa has become an endangered language (Unesco). Use of its script has been replaced by a foreign script, the Devanagara of India. This is an attempt to contribute to the revival of this language and script in its own land of origination. I shall appreciate very much of your feedback, comments for improvement of this little effort that your support may one day lead to the revival of this now endangered language Nepal Bhasa and its script, the Nepal Lipi.
